.SH NAME
vdsmd \- Virtual Desktops and Servers Manager
.br
@ENGINENAME@ host agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "service vdsmd start"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B VDSM
service is required by a
.B @ENGINENAME@
to manage oVirt Nodes
and Linux hosts. Currently, only Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
are supported. VDSM manages and monitors the host's
storage, memory and networks as well as virtual machine creation, other host
administration tasks, statistics gathering, and log collection.

VDSM should be run as a daemon on each node managed by @ENGINENAME@.
It answers XML-RPC calls from clients (mostly @ENGINENAME@).

.SH HOOKS
VDSM is extendible: it has hooks in strategic locations, where it executes
external scripts.
.B
Hooks API is new and is subject to future changes.
Currently-supported hooks have self-explanatory names:
    before_vm_start, after_vm_start,
    before_vm_cont, after_vm_cont,
    before_vm_pause, after_vm_pause,
    before_vm_hibernate, after_vm_hibernate,
    before_vm_dehibernate, after_vm_dehibernate,
    before_vm_migrate_source, after_vm_migrate_source,
    before_vm_migrate_destination, after_vm_migrate_destination,
    before_vm_destroy, after_vm_destroy,
    before_vm_set_ticket, after_vm_set_ticket,
    before_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug_fail,
    before_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_unhotplug_fail,
    before_disk_hotplug, after_disk_hotplug,
    before_disk_hotunplug, after_disk_hotunplug,
    before_vdsm_start, after_vdsm_stop.

Each hook executes the scripts under
.FN /usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks/<hook-name>/
in lexicographic order.

.SS Hook environment
Each hook script (except before_vdsm_start and after_vdsm_stop) inherit the
environment of the VDSM process, with an additional variable
.B _hook_domxml
which holds the path of libvirt's
.B domain xml
representation of the relevant virtual machine.
The uuid of the virtual machine may be deduced from that xml, but it is also
available as the environment variable
.B vmId.
Hooks that handle NIC hotplug and hotunplug have the _hook_domxml variable but
it contains the representation of the NIC rather than the VM.
Hotplug/hotunplug disk hooks also have the _hook_dom_xml variable,
which contains the drive definition (not the VM).

On top of these, @ENGINENAME@ allows to set a collection of "custom parameters" for
each virtual machine.  Each of these parameters is provided to hooks as an
environment variable.

before_migration_destination (and before_dehibernation) hooks currently receive
the xml of the domain from the source host. The xml of the domain at the
destination will differ in various details.

The environment of before_vm_set_ticket and after_vm_set_ticket hooks is augmented
with a set of params passed by the caller of setVmTicket.

The environment of hooks specific to devices:
    before_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug_fail,
    before_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_unhotplug_fail,
    before_disk_hotplug, after_disk_hotplug,
    before_disk_hotunplug, after_disk_hotunplug.

Are all augmented by custom properties specific to those devices, 
sent by the caller of the hook. For example if before_nic_hotplug is called
with custom: {qos: '0.5', color: 'red'} then qos and color will be directly
available as environment variables when before_nic_hotplug is called.

.SS Hook execution
before_vdsm_start and after_vdsm_stop scripts are executed as user
.I root.
All the other hooks are executed as user
.I vdsm.

.B before_vm_start
scripts may edit the domain xml file (pointed by
.B _hook_domxml
) in order to change VDSM's definition of a
virtual machine before it reaches libvirt. As with all hooks, the China Store
Rule applies - if you break something, you own it. Any script can mess up
VDSM's operation badly. In particular, you may never change the uuid of the
domain, and should better know what you are doing if you remove a device from
the domain.

Standard error of hook scripts is collected into VDSM's log, which may be used
by scripts for debugging.

As a somewhat silly example, let us think of a script that warns when a
domain with too much memory is started on a host:

.nf
    #!/bin/bash

    mem=\`/usr/bin/xpath $_hook_domxml '/domain/memory/text()' 2> /dev/null\`

    if [ "$mem" -gt 1073741824 ]; then
        echo "Domain with more than Gb!" >&2
    fi

    exit 0
.fi

.SS Hook return code
Hook script must return one of the following return codes:

.PD 0
.TP
.B
0
the hook script ended successfully.
.TP
.B
1
the hook script failed, other hooks should be processed.
.TP
.B
2
the hook script failed, no further hooks should be processed.
.TP
.B
>2
reserved.

.TP
If a before_<action> hook fails, the <action> would be aborted.
However, before_vm_destroy's failure does not abort destroy().
