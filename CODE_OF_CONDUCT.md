# Community Code of Conduct

We want to keep the oVirt Community a great place to participate, but we
need your help to keep it that way.

The oVirt community is made up of a diverse mix of individuals using and
contributing to all aspects of the project from all over the world, and
we want to make sure that the community is a safe and friendly place for
everyone.

This code of conduct applies equally to founders, mentors and those
seeking help and guidance. It applies to all spaces managed by the oVirt
project, including IRC, mailing lists, GitHub, Gerrit, oVirt events, and
any other forums created by the project team which the community uses
for communication.

While we have contribution guidelines for specific tools, we expect all
members of our community to follow these general guidelines and be
accountable to the community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things
that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended
\- a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical
communities in which we participate.

1. Be Respectful
2. Be Tolerant
3. Resolve Conflicts the Community Way

## Be Respectful

Our community is defined by the interactions of its members. When people
are nice to each other, our community is nice.

It can be easy to forget, in a disconnected world, that behind the IRC
nickname or email address is a person. Please remember that when you
communicate with other users, contributors, or anyone outside the
community who interacts with us, whether in person or online. A
community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
productive one.

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for
poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration
now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. For example, when participating in technical
discussions, it’s important to stay on topic and keep in mind that the
discussion is about ideas, concepts, or processes, not about the people
behind them.

## Be Tolerant

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves
professionally. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
ability.

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This
includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Discriminatory jokes and language
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally-identifying information (“doxing”)
- Personal insults
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors
- Repeatedly participating in any of the above behaviors. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## Resolve Conflicts the Community Way

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time, and oVirt
is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and
differing views constructively and with the help of the community and
community processes. When our goals differ dramatically, we encourage
the creation of alternative implementations, so that the community can
test new ideas and contribute to the discussion.

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking
questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are
encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and
helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in
an appropriate forum.

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct or if you
have any questions about the code of conduct, please email the
[oVirt community team](mailto:community@ovirt.org) and describe the
situation or your question as clearly and detailed as possible.

These guidelines are based on the
[Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/)
and are inspired by various other community codes of conduct, in
particular the
[OpenStack Foundation Community Code of Conduct](https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/).
