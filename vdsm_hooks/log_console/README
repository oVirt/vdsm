log_console vdsm hook
=================================
This hook appends a VM's serial console to a log file on the host.

Installation:
* Use engine-config to set the appropriate custom properties as such:

Custom property for a VM:
    sudo engine-config -s "UserDefinedVMProperties=log_console=^(on|off)$"

Usage:

The hook can be enabled using one of two ways:

1. Set the VM property 'log_console' to 'on', for specific VMs, as needed, via
the engine. Set it to 'off', to explicitly disable the hook.

2. Set the environment variable 'log_console_vm_regexp', in
/etc/sysconfig/vdsm, to a regular expression matching the VM names for which
you want to enable the hook. Matching is done using Python's re.match().

If log_console is set to 'off', for some VM, the hook will be disabled,
regardless of the value of log_console_vm_regexp or whether the name matches.

If 'log_console' is not 'on', for some VM, and 'log_console_vm_regexp' does
not match, the hook will be disabled. So by default, with both variables
being empty/unset, the hook is disabled.

In principle, a future version might enable it by default, based on feedback
from users.

Using log_console_vm_regexp is useful, in particular, for enabling the hook
for a HostedEngine VM, for which using 'log_console' is less practical, as
the engine might be down exactly when you want to use it (to help diagnose
why it's down...).

The logs are currently hard-coded to
/var/log/libvirt/qemu/{vm_name}-console.log .

TODO: Allow putting logs elsewhere.
This also requires fiddling with selinux/permissions.
