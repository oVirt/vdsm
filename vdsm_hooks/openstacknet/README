openstacknet vdsm hook
======================
This hook will treat vNICs that need to be handled by an OpenStack Network
provider.
The hook receives a plugin type + id for the vNIC and chages the libvirt XML
according to the plugin type:
o   Linux Bridge: Due to libvirt's missing feature [1], prior to the device
        creation we connect the hook to a dummy bridge and disconnect it from
        this bridge after the device has been created.
        At this point, the Linux Bridge Agent will take the created tap device
        (identified by it's name) and connect it to the correct bridge.
o   Open vSwitch: The hook adds the correct information to the vNIC XML to
        connect correctly to the vSwitch.
        Currently the hook connects to the 'br-int' bridge by default.

syntax:
device: { ...,
          'custom': { 'provider_type': 'OPENSTACK_NETWORK',
                      'plugin_type': one of ('LINUX_BRIDGE', 'OPEN_VSWITCH'),
                      'vnic_id': 'some id'}
        }
