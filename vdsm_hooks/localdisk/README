localdisk vdsm hook
===================

This hook add the ability to use fast local storage instead of shared
storage, while using shared storage for managing VM templates.
In the current system, a user have to choose between fast local storage
sharing nothing with other hosts, or shared storage, where everything is
shared between the hosts and fast local storage cannot be used.
This feature try to mix both local and shared storage.

A user will create a VM normally on shared storage of any type.
To use the VM with local storage, the user will have to pin the VM to a certain
host, and enable the localdisk hook.

When starting the VM on the pinned host, the localdisk hook will copy the
VM disks from shared storage into the host local storage, and modify the
disk path to use the local copy of the disk.

The original disk may be a single volume or a chain of volumes based
on a template. The local copy is a raw preallocated volume using a LVM logical
volume on the special "ovirt-local" volume group.

Most operations are not supported on a VM using the localdisk hook.
For example, the VM cannot be migrated to another host, cannot create snapshots,
copy the local disk to other storage, etc.

To change storage on a VM using local storage, the localdisk hook must be disabled.

Here a description of the hook flow:
- If a matching local LV exists without the "UPDATING" tag:
  - update the disk path and format and return.
- If no matching local LV exists:
  - create a new LV with "UPDATING" tag.
  - copy the data from the shared storage disk/template.
  - once the copy operation is done, remove the "UPDATING" tag.
  - update the disk path and format and return.
- If a matching local LV exists with the "UPDATING":
  - delete the LV
  - create a new LV with "UPDATING" tag.
  - copy the data from the shared storage disk/template.
  - once the copy operation is done, remove the "UPDATING" tag.
  - update the disk path and format and return.


Note:

The system administrator will be responsible for creating the host "ovirt-local"
volume group and extending it with new devices if needed.

The VM must be pinned to host. Any migration will cause the VM to try to
start with local disks that are not available on the new host.

The operator need to configure the engine UserDefinedVMProperties to support
'localdisk' with value 'lvm' :
engine-config -s UserDefinedVMProperties='localdisk=^(lvm)?$'

Support thin LVM
