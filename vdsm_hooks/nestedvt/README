VDSM Nested Virtualization
==========================
This hook provides the support for nested virtualization in the guests managed
by VDSM. After installing the hook it is recomended to reboot the host to make
the new modprobe configuration effective, alternatively it is possible to try
to reload the kvm module:

 # modprobe -r [kvm-intel|kvm-amd]
 # modprobe [kvm-intel|kvm-amd]

The nested option should now be enabled:

 # cat /sys/module/kvm*/parameters/nested
 Y

This hook assumes that your kernel supports nested virtualization.
