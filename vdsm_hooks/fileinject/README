fileinject vdsm hook
====================
hook is getting target file name and its content and
create that file in target machine.

hook will try to add the file only to the operation system
partition, i.e.
Windows: /c/myfile
Linux: /myfile

Please note that in Windows the path is case sensitive!

syntax:
    fileinject=/<target file name> : <file content>
    fileinject=/myfile:some file content\netc...


Important note for Block Device:
If the disk that you are trying to inject is block device (ie iScsi or Fiber Channel)
the disk format must be "Preallocated" (not "thin provisioned") or the fileinject
hook will fail and abort the running VM process!

Note for SELinux:
if you are running SELinux, you need to run this command on the server
(temporary until bug #730662 is solved):
# setsebool -P allow_unconfined_qemu_transition 0

create file in guest disk and upload to it the file content
please note that it must have "root" path ie '/' in linux and c:\ in windows
for example:
    Linux (case sensitive):
        fileinject:/etc/myfile.txt:content
    Windows (case insensitive):
        fileinject:/c/windows/myfile.txt:content

which mean that windows must start with '/c/' prefix (if the windows os in in c:\ /d/ for d:\)
and must start with '/' for linux based machines
