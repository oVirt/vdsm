vmfex_dev vdsm hook
======================

Override a oVirt engine's vnic with a Cisco VM-FEX VM vNic connected using
SR-IOV passthrough with macvtap (allows migration).

Before Installation:
* Make sure that the VM level vmfex hook is not installed. vmfex_dev and
  vmfex hooks are not compatible and running them at the same time can cause
  all sorts of problems.

Installation:
* Use the engine-config to append the appropriate custom property:

  sudo engine-config -s CustomDeviceProperties=
  '{type=interface;prop={vmfex=^[a-zA-Z0-9_ ---]+$}}'

* Verify that the vmfex_dev custom device propertes were properly added:
	sudo engine-config -g CustomDeviceProperties

Usage:
1. Define an oVirt vNIC profile and set one of its custom properites to
   "vmfex" with the value of the name of UCS port profile. For instance:
       vmfex: myPortProfileId
2. Attach the oVirt vNIC profile to a VM vNIC. When the VM runs, the vNIC with
   the vmfex custom device, the xml definition of which might originally look
   like:
       <interface type='bridge'>
           <mac address='<mac>'/>
           <model type='virtio'/>
           <source bridge='<logical network>'/>
       </interface>
    will be transformed into:
        <interface type='network'>
          <mac address='<mac>'/>
          <source network='direct-pool'/>
          <virtualport type='802.1Qbh'>
              <parameters profileid='<Port Profile id>'/>
          </virtualport>
          <model type='virtio'/>
        </interface>
