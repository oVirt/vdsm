log_firmware vdsm hook
=================================
This hook appends a VM's firmware debug logging to a log file on the host.

Installation:
* Use engine-config to set the appropriate custom properties as such:

Custom property for a VM:
    sudo engine-config -s "UserDefinedVMProperties=log_firmware=^(on|off)$"

* Prepare the log directory on the host:
    sudo mkdir -p /var/log/qemu-firmware
    sudo chown qemu /var/log/qemu-firmware
    sudo chcon -t qemu_var_run_t /var/log/qemu-firmware
    sudo chmod 700 /var/log/qemu-firmware

Usage:

The hook can be enabled using one of two ways:

1. Set the VM property 'log_firmware' to 'on', for specific VMs, as needed, via
the engine. Set it to 'off', to explicitly disable the hook.

2. Set the environment variable 'log_firmware_vm_regexp', in
/etc/sysconfig/vdsm, to a regular expression matching the VM names for which
you want to enable the hook. Matching is done using Python's re.match().

If log_firmware is set to 'off', for some VM, the hook will be disabled,
regardless of the value of log_firmware_vm_regexp or whether the name matches.

If 'log_firmware' is not 'on', for some VM, and 'log_firmware_vm_regexp' does
not match, the hook will be disabled. So by default, with both variables
being empty/unset, the hook is disabled.

In principle, a future version might enable it by default, based on feedback
from users.

Using log_firmware_vm_regexp is useful, in particular, for enabling the hook
for a HostedEngine VM, for which using 'log_firmware' is less practical, as
the engine might be down exactly when you want to use it (to help diagnose
why it's down...).

The logs are written to the directory set with the environment variable
log_firmware_dir, or to /var/log/qemu-firmware if it's not set.
If you do set it, you should prepare the directory as detailed above.
The logs' filenames, inside this directory, are {vm_name}-firmware.log,
where {vm_name} is replaced with the VM's name.

TODO: I'd like to be able to be able to write log files to
/var/log/libvirt/qemu, like other logs, but that's not easy.
