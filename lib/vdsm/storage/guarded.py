    """
    A context manager to lock groups of storage entities for an operation.

    When performing an operation on storage (eg. copying data from one volume
    to another volume), the entities (volumes) must be locked to protect them
    from conflicting access by other threads of this application and (in the
    future) from simultaneous access by other hosts.  This requires the use of
    multiple layers of locks and rigid lock ordering rules to prevent deadlock.

    This class receives a variable number of lock lists corresponding to each
    entity involved in an operation.  The locks from all entities are grouped
    together and any duplicate locks removed.  Next, the locks are sorted by
    namespace and then by name.  When entering the context the locks are
    acquired in sorted order.  When exiting the context the locks are released
    in reverse order.  Errors are handled as gracefully as possible with any
    acquired locks being released in the proper order.

    Attemping to lock the same lock twice with differnt mode is not supported
    and will raise a Deadlock exception with the conflicting locks.
