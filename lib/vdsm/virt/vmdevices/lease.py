"""
lease - manage lease devices in the virt subsystem.

Overview
--------

Vdsm storage subsystem is creating sanlock leases (paxos leases) on
shared storage. To acquire a lease for a vm, we add a "lease" device to
the domain xml.  Libvirt would connect to sanlock, acquire the lease,
and then pass the sanlock fd to qemu. When qemu terminates, sanlock
detects that the fd was closed, and release the lease.

Sanlock is ensuring that if a host is connected to storage, and the
owner of the lease is running, the lease cannot be acquired on another
host. If the host cannot access storage, sanlock will kill the owner of
the lease, so the lease can be acquired from another host.

Lease types
-----------

We have two kinds of leases:

1. Volume leases - each volume has a lease area on storage. If a drive
   is with shared="exclusive", we add a lease device for the drive top
   volume to the domain xml. The lease information is returned when
   preparing an image using `Image.prepare` verb.

2. VM leases - each vm may have a lease area on storage, accesible using
   the VM uuid. Engine send a lease device spec with partial
   information, and the missing details are fetched using `Lease.info`
   verb.

Drive with volume leases do not support live snaphost, hotplug/unplug,
or live storage migration. In this case we need to unplug the lease
device for the old volume, and plug a new lease device for the new
volume. This is not implemented yet, and instead we just block these
operation if a drive has a volume lease.

VM lease is implemented using external leases, which are more generic
than drive leases; actually drive leases can be implemented using
external leases. When using VM lease, live snapshot, hotplug/unplug and
live storge migration (should) work.

From libvirt point of view, there is no difference between drive leases
or vm lease, all are lease devices.

APIs in this module
-------------------

- `lease.CannotPrepare` - raised if preparing a lease fails. This is a
  fatal error failing to start a vm.

- `lease.MissingArgument` - raised if required argument is missing when
  creating a `lease.Device`. This is a fatal error failing to start a
  vm.

- `lease.Device` - a libvirt lease device, creating the xml for the
  domain xml.

- `lease.prepare` - prepare lease devices information so a
  `lease.Device` can be created.
