class Barrier(object):

    A barrier is synchronizing number of threads specified when the barrier
    was created.

    A barrier is created in a "filling" state. In this state, all threads
    invoking wait() will block until count threads have entered the barrier, or
    the specified timeout has expired.

    When the last thread has entered the barrier, the barrier switch state to
    "draining", and all threads are woken up. When the last thread has left the
    barrier, it switch state to "filling" again.

    Threads trying to enter the barrier when it is in "draining" state will
    block until it switch state to "filling", and then wait again until the
    barrier is in "draining" state.

    This class is behaves mostly like pthread_barrier_wait():
    http://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_barrier_wait.

    Unlike pthread_barrier_wait(), this class supports an optional timeout,
    ensuring that threads will not wait forever. However, if one thread timed
    out, all threads waiting on this stage will timeout, since threads are
    waiting to each other.

    Example usage::

        barrier = Barrier(5)

        def thread():
            barrier.wait()

        for i in range(4):
            threading.Thread(target=thread).start()

        # Will block until all threads started above are blocked on wait(). The
        # last thread calling wait() will wake up all waiting threads.
