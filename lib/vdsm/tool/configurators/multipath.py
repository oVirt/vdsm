    #
    # Using "queue" will cause commands run by vdsm (e.g. lvm) to get
    # stuck for unlimited time, causing timeouts in various flows, and
    # may cause a host to become non-responsive.
    #
    # Using "fail" will cause VMs to pause shortly after all paths have
    # failed. When using a HA VM with a storage lease, the lease will be
    # released. This may delay the time to restart the VM on another

    #
    # With FC, multipath sets the sysfs fast_io_fail_tmo value for the
    # remote ports associated with the path devices.  Multipath sets
    # this value whenever a device is reloaded (e.g. when a new path is
    # added or removed). This will override any change made in

    #
    # - Set this if you want failed devices to be removed from the system.
    # - Do not set this is you want failed devices to stay around, since
    #   after they are removed, they need to be rediscovered to get them
    #   back.
    # - Do not set this if the root file system is multipathed. In this
    #   case you want to set dev_loss_tmo to "infinity".  If you don't,

#
# Other protocols are not blacklisted for following reasons:
# scsi:fcp      officially supported
# scsi:iscsi    officially supported
# scsi:sas      not supported, but not blacklisting it to avoid breaking
#               existing user setup, known to be used by users
# cciss         not supported, but not blacklisting it to avoid breaking
#               existing user setup, known to be used by users

# nvme          can be used with multipath setup, protocols like NVMe-oF will
#               come up as nvme
# scsi:spi      superseded by scsi:fcp, not a local device, no need to
#               blacklist it
# scsi:ssa      superseded by scsi:fcp, not a local device, no need to
#               blacklist it
#
# Devices running scsi:ata and scsi:unspec are quite common and almost always
# cannot create multipath, so it would be good to blacklist them. But in
# general multipath can be create on top either of these devices, so we don't
# black list them to avoid breaking anyone's setup.
#
# You can make blacklist more restrictive by creating drop-in config file,
# e.g. /etc/multipath/conf.d/local.conf, and extend blacklist
# according to your needs, e.g.
#
#   blacklist {
#       protocol "(scsi:ata|scsi:unspec)"
#   }
#
# You can also add exceptions to blacklist (see man(5) multipath.conf for more
# details) by adding blacklist_exceptions to your drop-in configuration file,
# e.g.
#
#   blacklist_exceptions {
#       protocol "(scsi:spi|scsi:ssa)"
#   }
#
# We blacklist all RADOS Block Device (RBD) devices.
# When using Ceph, multipath prevents the rbd devices from being unmapped
# and the devices remain busy.
