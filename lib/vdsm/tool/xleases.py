    WARNING:

        This is a destructive operation - you must put the storage
        domain into maintenance before running this tool.

    Format the xleases volume index, dropping all leases from the index.
    This does not delete sanlock resources on the volume. If you want to
    restore existing sanlock resources, use rebuild-index. If you want
    to delete also sanlock resources on this volume you can wipe the
    entire volume using dd before formatting it.

    Notes:

    - With iSCSI based storage you may need to connect to the traget
      using iscsiadm.

    - With file based storage, you may need to mount the storage domain.

    - With block based stoage, you need to activate the xleases logical
      volume before the operation, and deactivate after the operation.

    If formatting fails, the volume will not be usable (it will be
    marked as "updating"), but the operation can be tried again.

    Creating xleases volume on file storage:

        PATH=/rhev/data-center/mnt/server:_path/sd-id/dom_md/xleases
        truncate -s 1G $PATH
        vdsm-tool format-xleases sd-id $PATH

    Creating the xleases volume on block storage:

        lvcreate --name xleases --size 1g sd-id
        vdsm-tool format-xleases sd-id /dev/sd-id/xleases
        lvchange -an sd-id/xleases

    WARNING:

        This is a destructive operation - you must put the storage
        domain into maintenance before running this tool.
        The xleases volume index is the source of truth so rebuilding
        from storage can break it badly.

    Rebuild the xleases volume index, restoring all sanlock resource on
    the xleases volume. If you want to drop all leases in the index, use
    format-xleases.

    Notes:

    - With iSCSI based storage you may need to connect to the traget
      using iscsiadm.

    - With file based storage, you may need to mount the storage domain.

    - With block based stoage, you need to activate the xleases logical
      volume before the operation, and deactivate after the operation.

    If rebuilding fails, the volume will not be usable (it will be
    marked as "updating"), but the operation can be tried again.

    Rebuilding xleases volume on file storage:

        PATH=/rhev/data-center/mnt/server:_path/sd-id/dom_md/xleases
        vdsm-tool rebuild-xleases sd-id $PATH

    Rebuilding the xleases volume on block storage:

        lvchange -ay sd-id/xleases
        vdsm-tool rebuild-xleases sd-id /dev/sd-id/xleases
        lvchange -an sd-id/xleases
