"""
This module provides a Scheduler class scheduling execution of
a callable on a background thread.

To use a scheduler, create an instance and start it:

    scheduler = schedule.Scheduler()
    scheduler.start()

The scheduler default clock is time.time. This clock is not monotonic, which
may cause scheduled calls to fire too early or too late if the system time is
modified by the administrator or by ntp service. If you care about this and can
live with monotonic_time's lower resolution, you can use it as the clock.

    scheduler = schedule.Scheduler(clock=monotonic_time)

When you want to schedule some callable:

    def task():
        print('30 seconds passed')

    scheduler.schedule(30.0, task)

Task will be called after 30.0 seconds on the scheduler background thread.

If you need to cancel a scheduled call, keep the ScheduledCall object returned
from Scheduler.schedule(), and cancel the task:

    scheduled_call = scheduler.schedule(30.0, call)
    ...
    scheduled_call.cancel()

Finally, when the scheduler is not needed any more:

    scheduler.stop()

This will cancel any pending calls and terminate the scheduler thread.
